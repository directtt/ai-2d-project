# tractor-ai-2d-project
Python reinforcement learning 2D project for my AI classes that uses search algorithms, machine learning, neural networks and genetic algorithm.

## General idea
General idea of classes was to implement throughout semester end-to-end AI project that consist of:
- Implementation of a two-dimensional discrete environment (aka lattice) for an autonomous agent using knowledge representation techniques presented in lectures
- Application of informed state space search strategies to solve the problem of scheduling agent movement in the environment
- Application of selected machine learning methods to solve problems that the agent must face in the surrounding environment

## Algorithms use case 
- Searching Algorithms: BFS & A* for agent shortest path finding
- Machine Learning: XGBoost
